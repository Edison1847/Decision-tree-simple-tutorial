# Decision-tree-simple-tutorial
This repository contains a simple tutorial for beginners on implementing a decision tree classifier to predict heart disease using a well-known dataset. 
You can directly access the colab file directly fom the DT.ipynb file

**The project covers the following key aspects:**

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing: How to load the heart disease dataset and preprocess the data for modeling.
2. Decision Tree Classifier: Step-by-step guide to building and training a decision tree classifier.
3. Model Evaluation: Techniques for evaluating the model's performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and other relevant metrics.
4. Visualization: Methods to visualize the decision tree for better understanding and interpretation.

The tutorial is designed to be beginner-friendly, with clear explanations and commented code to help you understand the concepts and processes involved in decision tree classification.
